# Games
##  The Games Project
### Part of [Dockyard Academy](https://github.com/DockYard-Academy/curriculum)

<br>

Games included:
- Guessing Game
- Rock Paper Scissors
- Wordle

<br>

  In the Games project, beyond the challenge of writing the games themselves, we learned how to:
- Document Elixir modules and functions.
- Test for Elixir modules and functions.
- Use dialyzer to check for type errors.
- Use ExDoc to generate documentation.
- Use Credo to check for code style errors.
