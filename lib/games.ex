  Documentation for the `Games` project completed as part of Dockyard Academy.

  Games included:
    - `Games.GuessingGame`
    - `Games.RockPaperScissors`
    - `Games.Wordle`

  In the Games project, beyond the challenge of writing the games themselves, we learned how to:
    - Document Elixir modules and functions.
    - Test for Elixir modules and functions.
    - Use dialyzer to check for type errors.
    - Use ExDoc to generate documentation.
    - Use Credo to check for code style errors.
